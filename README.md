## V1

### To-Do:

- Implement a maximum limit for flags
- Stop the timer when the game ends

### Bugs:

- After winning, clicking on a flagged cell should not trigger a loss (update classList to prevent the "boom" effect)
- Unable to remove a flag if placed incorrectly
- Some inconsistencies in the loop that generates mines
